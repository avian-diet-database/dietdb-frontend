                    <p className="">Diet is typically assessed by behavioral observation or
                    by examining stomach contents, nest debris, or fecal contents. Regardless of the study
                    method, researchers have historically used three different methods for quantifying the
                    prevalence of a prey type:</p>

                            <li>Fraction of the diet by number of prey items (e.g., there was evidence
                            of 3 beetles out of 50 total prey items)</li>
                            <li>Fraction of the diet by weight or volume (e.g., beetles comprised 26%
                            of the mass of the total stomach contents)</li>
                            <li>Percent occurrence (e.g., 65% of stomachs examined had at least one beetle)</li>
