## 0. Avian Diet Database

A mobile-friendly web page that presents bird diet information using  data compiled by Prof. Hurlbertâ€™s <br />lab in an interactive and easy to digest manner. It does this using data visualizations (e.g. maps, graphs, etc.)<br /> along with interactive filters (e.g. geographic, temporal, taxonomic, etc.) that provide a variety of ways to <br />explore the relationships between a bird and its diet.
