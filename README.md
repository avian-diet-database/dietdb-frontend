## 0. Avian Diet Database

A mobile-friendly web page that presents bird diet information using  data compiled by Prof. Hurlbertâ€™s <br />lab in an interactive and easy to digest manner. It does this using data visualizations (e.g. maps, graphs, etc.)<br /> along with interactive filters (e.g. geographic, temporal, taxonomic, etc.) that provide a variety of ways to <br />explore the relationships between a bird and its diet.

2. Run npm install to have all the libraries

    `npm install`

### Running Locally
In the project, you can run 

`npm run start-dev`

to launch a local server to see the unbuilt files live.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

`npm run start`

Launches the app from the build folder. This will not live-update, run build in order to see updates.
