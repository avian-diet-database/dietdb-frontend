## 0. Avian Diet Database

A mobile-friendly web page that presents bird diet information using  data compiled by Prof. Hurlbert’s <br />lab in an interactive and easy to digest manner. It does this using data visualizations (e.g. maps, graphs, etc.)<br /> along with interactive filters (e.g. geographic, temporal, taxonomic, etc.) that provide a variety of ways to <br />explore the relationships between a bird and its diet.

## 1. Getting Started
### Prerequisites
### Installing
### Running Locally
In the project, you can run 

### `npm run-script start-dev`

to launch a local server to see the unbuilt files live.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run start`

Launches the app from the build folder. This will not live-update, run build in order to see updates.



### Warranty
These instructions were last tested on Nov. 9th, 2020 by Muyan Pan on Windows 10

## 2. Testing 
### `npm test`

Launches the Jest test suites while file-watching.<br />

Use the options '-- --coverage --watchAll=false' to generate a code coverage report.

## 3. Deployment

The backend is deployed using Heroku.

The production database is deployed using Carolina Cloud Apps. 

When local changes are pushed on to GitHub, the changes will be built automatically,<br /> and the production will be updated.
